            Ergo Foundation is committed to organic and non-breaking development of Ergo Platform protocol. The Foundation takes care that the changes approved not only by miners (who express their will directly on the blockchain), but also users, projects building on top of Ergo and core developers. The Foundation is also dedicated to help with building trustless environments, smart contracts and payment frameworks for the public with privacy in mind. Our activities include fundraising, research, maintenance of Ergo Platform, improvements for Ergo Platform, marketing and events. We believe that the Ergo Treasury should be used mainly by open community, including freelancers, hackers, experts and enthusiasts. Information about Ergo`s Treasury and protocol can be found at

            The cryptographic part of Ergo script is based on sigma protocols and naturally supports threshold m-of-n signatures, ring signatures and more. Keeping all this in mind, we expect ErgoScript and Ergo’s design to make it uniquely useful as Contractual Money with countless applications possible. Ergo DApps and offchain protocols may be implemented in a truly decentralized way due to light clients.

          <p class="eg-text__paragraph eg-text__paragraph--18">
            For more fundamental changes Ergo is following a soft-forkability approach --- if an overwhelming majority of the network accepts a new feature, it is activated, however, old nodes which do not upgrade continue to operate normally and just skip over this feature validation. Thus disruptive hard forks should not be required in Ergo.
          </p>
          <p class="eg-text__paragraph eg-text__paragraph--18">
            Ergo mining will always be stable, unlike Bitcoin and other PoW currencies, in which mining may become unstable after the emission period. Second, state size growth becomes controllable and predictable reducing hardware requirements for Ergo miners. Third, by collecting storage fees from outdated boxes, miners return lost coins to circulation preventing a steady decrease of circulating supply due to lost keys. To achieve survivability, Ergo provides economic improvements in addition to the technical ones, most central of which is a storage fee component which plays an important role for Ergo‘s stability.

            All cryptocurrencies rely on contributions from the scientific research community. Gladly Ergo brings it in the core!
