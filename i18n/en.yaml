  translation: "Started more ten years ago with the Bitcoin, blockchain technology proved to be a secure way of maintaining a public transaction ledger. However, whereas many teams claimed to implement the next revolutionary blockchain, they have also mostly broken at least one of fundamental blockchain properties.
  <br/>
  In contrast, Ergo platform absorbs ready-to-use ideas, that are well-tested and formalized in scientific papers. Its primary focus is to provide an efficient, secure and easy way to implement financial contracts, that will be useful and survivable in the long term. Finally, Ergo is a self-amendable protocol, that allows to absorb new ideas and improve itself in the future in a decentralized manner."

- id: ergo_decentralization_text
  translation: "Outstanding resilience of blockchain systems is achieved by a combination of modern cryptographic algorithms and decentralized architecture. While cryptography is widely used outside the cryptocurrencies, decentralized architecture forms a unique property of blockchain systems making them even more secure due to lack of single point of failure.
  <br/>
  Ergo struggle with the centralization at all levels. Ergo have an ASIC and pool resistant Proof-of-Work algorithm, preventing blockchain centralization in the hands of miners and pool operators. Its treasury system allows preventing governance and development centralization, while light nodes with high-security guaranties prevent services centralization"

- id: ergo_economy_text
  translation: "To achieve survivability, Ergo provides economic improvements in addition to the technical ones. A storage rent component makes Ergo similar to regular cloud storage services. However it has several significant consequences: it makes Ergo mining stable after the initial emission, prevents state size growth and provides a way to return coins to circulation.
  <br/>
  This component also predetermines the value of Ergo native token - it is a utility token used to pay for storage rent. The Ergo platform is suitable to build monetary systems on top of it with properties different from Ergo native token itself, however, participating such systems would require to use Ergo native token preventing spam attacks and making the network more secure."

- id: ergo_contractual_text
  translation: "The overwhelming majority of public blockchain use-cases are about financial applications, even in platforms that claim to be a general-purpose decentralized world computer. For example, if an oracle is writing non-financial data into a blockchain, this data is usually to be written to be used in a financial contract.
                   <br/>
                   Ergo offers a powerful and protocol-friendly scripting language based on Σ-protocols, that allows specifying conditions under which a coin can be used. In the simple case, a coin can be spent at any time by an owner of a secret key, but more complex spending conditions may specify multiple coin holders, time of spending, the direction of spending and so on, allowing to implement contracts of arbitrary complexity."

- id: ergo_survivability_text
  translation: "Being a platform for contractual money, Ergo should also support long-term contracts for a period of a person’s life. Ergo general approach is to use well-tested solutions proved to be secure in the long-term, even if that leads to slower short-term innovations.
  <br/>
  Combination of PoW consensus protocol and authenticated state prevents performance degradation over time, allowing to join the network and use it from commodity hardware. Ergo economy model makes the system more reliable from the economic point of view, while on-chain governance allows gradual changes in the network parameters."

- id: ergo_clients_text
  translation: "One of the key aspects of Ergo is that it is created for regular people. In particular, that means that they should be able to participate in the protocol by running a full node, mining or creating transactions with the absence of trusted parties.
  <br/>
  Ergo protocol is friendly to Light clients, allowing to use it in a friendly and decentralized manner with full node security guarantees. The same properties of Ergo make it easier to implement sidechains, providing additional benefits in terms of throughput."

  translation: Vision

- id: basics_vision
  translation: "Ergo was created in response to stagnation in the blockchain area. It implements various technical and economic ready-to-use ideas that add value to the project but does not reduce the known advantages of cryptocurrencies. Ergo primary focus is to provide an efficient and secure way to implement financial contracts, which are the most widely used application of blockchain technology. It is created to provide an easy way to use financial contracts by ordinary people, that should be able to use them in a decentralized manner without any trust. Ergo protocol is designed to be survivable in a long-term focus, making it useful to implement contracts for a period of a person’s life."

- id: basics_consensus_title
  translation: Consensus

- id: basics_consensus
  translation: "Consensus protocol of Ergo — Autolykos — is based on the well-known Proof-of-Work (“PoW”) consensus algorithm.
                  PoW was chosen for several reasons including that PoW protocols are widely studied, have high security guarantees, and are friendly to light clients.
                  However, Autolykos have several meaningful differences from the Bitcoin PoW.
                  First, it is memory-hard reducing the disparity between specialized hardware (ASICs) and commodity GPU, allowing ordinary people to participate in mining to secure the network and receive the reward.
                  Second, Autolykos is the first production implementation of pool-resistant mining, enforcing to perform solo mining and keeping the network decentralized."

- id: basics_clients_title
  translation: Light clients

- id: basics_clients
  translation: "It is almost impossible to use existing cryptocurrencies without the help of trusted third-parties. To receive even a small amount of coins in a trustless fashion, a client must download and process gigabytes of data to synchronize with the network, which may take several weeks even on high-end hardware, not to mention mobile devices. It is, therefore, no surprise that most users prefer to use trusted solutions for wallets, exchanges, block explorers and so on. <br/>
                  Ergo was designed to be maximally user-friendly in the sense of decentralization. One of the important properties of PoW is that it enables verification of the work done without downloading the full chain. Ergo blocks support NiPoPoW proofs, allowing light clients to synchronize with the network by downloading less than a megabyte of data. Also, Ergo uses authenticated state, and for any transaction included, a client may download proof of its correctness. Thus, regardless of the blockchain size, a regular user with a smart-phone can join the network and start using Ergo with the same security guarantees as a full node."

  translation: Survivability

- id: basics_survivability
  translation: "To survive in the long-term, Ergo prefers well-tested solutions. If there isn't already a well-teste solution for some problem, we perform our own research, and the number of peer-reviewed papers from the Ergo development team is already extensive.
                  <br/>  To be survivable, the network should adapt to changing environment without the intervention of trusted parties (such as a ``core developer'' team). Ergo's on-chain miner voting protocol allows gradual changes in a large number of parameters including maximum block size, storage fee factor and more.
                  <br/> For more fundamental changes Ergo is going to follow a soft-forkability approach --- if an overwhelming majority of the network accepts a new feature, it is activated, however, old nodes which do not upgrade continue to operate normally and just skip over this feature validation.
  "

  translation: Economy

- id: basics_ecomony_paragraph
  translation: "
  To achieve survivability, Ergo provides economic improvements in addition to the technical ones, most central of which is a storage fee component which plays an important role for Ergo‘s stability: if an output remains in the state for 4 years without being moved, a miner may charge a small fee for every byte kept in the state. This idea is similar to regular cloud storage services, but it was only proposed quite recently for cryptocurrencies and has several significant consequences. First, Ergo mining will always be stable, unlike Bitcoin and other PoW currencies, in which mining may become unstable after the emission period. Second, state size growth becomes controllable and predictable reducing hardware requirements for Ergo miners. Third, by collecting storage fees from outdated boxes, miners return coins to circulation preventing a steady decrease of circulating supply due to lost keys. Finally, it also predetermines the value of Ergo native token - it is a utility token used to pay for storage rent. While Ergo users are free to implement any kind of applications on top of it, they would require to use Ergo native token as well in order to pay storage rent.

  translation: Applicability

- id: basics_applicability_paragraph
  translation: "Ergo DApps and offchain protocols may be implemented in a truly decentralized way due to light clients, however, they also require a flexible and safe smart contract language. Ergo smart contracts are based on a Bitcoin-like UTXO model, where every output is protected by some script. If the scripting language is rich enough, it enables writing of Turing-complete contracts while avoiding ad-hoc solutions for program halting like gas in Ethereum. While having significantly more versatility than Bitcoin script, Ergo script only contains operations, that allow estimation of script complexity before execution, which prevents various DoS attacks. However, these instructions set is enough to write any possible program — ErgoScript was proven to be Turing complete. The cryptographic part of Ergo script is based on sigma protocols and naturally supports threshold m-of-n signatures, ring signatures and more."
