subtitle: Armeanio and Kushti had a discussion about everything that happened in
  2021, and what we can look forward to in 2022.  They discussed the highs and
  lows, the things that can be improved, lessons learnt, as well as the things
  that went brilliantly and the huge progress that was made. 2022 promises to be
  very exciting indeed for Ergo, as we are poised for yet more ecosystem growth.
