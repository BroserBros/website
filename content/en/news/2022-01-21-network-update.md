subtitle: anetaBTC held an airdrop event yesterday and with it the hoards of
  airdrop hunters descended on Ergo. Due to the power of the eUTXO model &
  ErgoScript they were able to distribute 5000 transactions bundled into
  one.  This transaction, when included in the block and then mined, ended up
  causing exhaustion on the P2P layer. The fix is now being rolled out to pools
  and Kushti has provided information the regarding issue.
