title: "Ergo Summit: Privacy Event"
date: 2022-02-04T17:00:00.000Z
subtitle: From February 17-23 on our YouTube channel, we will host the first of
  three Ergo Summits for 2022. In order to achieve mainstream adoption,
  blockchain needs to be able to provide a balance of privacy and transparency.
  Ergo provides that balance with uncompromising security.  Privacy protects
  individuals and corporate secrets while transparency allows for the peace of
  mind that all entities are operating within the legal parameters of their
  respective jurisdictions.  Be sure to join us for this exclusive event,
  featuring presentations and discussions from some of the leading experts in
  the blockchain industry.
