subtitle: In last week’s AMA, Dan updated the community on exchange listings,
  the engagement of an OTC desk, new business partnerships, and education
  initiatives.  Dan and Armeanio answered questions from the community covering
  transaction efficiency, commercial adoption, Ergo’s blockchain metrics,
  venture capital investors, user interface, and much more. They talk about the
  new Nautilus wallet and we learn that Dan’s Star Trek trivia is not to be
  challenged!  All this and more in your AMA Wrap-Up from January 28, 2022!
