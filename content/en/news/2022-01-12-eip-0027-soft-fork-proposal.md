title: EIP 0027 Soft Fork Proposal
date: 2022-01-12T13:09:29.132Z
subtitle: "There are a lot of concerns about the emission being over in less
  than six years from now. Ergo is committed to the principle that the total
  supply must be preserved.  The long-term sustainability of the short emission
  schedule is an inherent risk to the long-term viability of the Ergo
  Network.  We would like to create a system that offers economic incentives to
  miners while protecting the long-term crypto-economic security of the
  network.  A 90% approval rate is required, which is a supermajority.  Joseph
  Armeanio explains:"
