As a technical writer for Ergo Platform, you will be responsible for writing specialist information about Ergo’s technology and applications, and how they work. You will need to both be able to explain how things are used in a general way that is easy to understand to the end-user - or write highly technical documentation for developers. The information may be presented in the form of user guides for software applications, reference and instruction manuals for appliances, training guides, instructional videos or online help incorporated into software and operating guides.

As a technical author, you'll need to understand the product or applications and then design and write documentation to explain it to users. You may also provide this information in various other forms including software demos and interactive tutorials, wikis, blogs and podcasts, using video, illustrations and graphics.

## Responsibilities

As a technical author, you'll assess the audience and the nature of the documentation, and will need to:

* attend planning and briefing meetings
* collaborate with developers and managers to clarify any technical issues
* interview experts and concerned specialists
* work with translators, printers and service providers.

A large part of your job will be spent researching and gathering the information required. You'll need to:

* use the product or service in question to understand the technology and applications for which documentation is being prepared
* gather and analyse the information needs of the user.

Then comes the challenge of presenting the information. For this, you'll:

* organise information according to your user's needs
* write and edit text
* commission, coordinate or prepare illustrations
* use a variety of software applications to present the information
* index and catalogue material.

Related administration may involve:

* working on and managing multiple projects simultaneously
* creating work schedules
* marketing - publicising services and skills to potential clients
* keeping up to date with developments and trends in the industry and attending training courses.

## What to expect

* Work is completely based online, although you'll often visit clients and spend time in the field to carry out research.
* You may also work in a team with other professionals such as graphic designers, user experience designers, software developers and testers.
* Self-employment or freelance work is common after gaining experience, and can pay more. Contracts vary from a few days to several months and technical authors typically work on several projects at once.
* Jobs are available across the UK but may be more easily found in large cities.
* Travel within a working day and overnight absence from home are occasionally required. There are some opportunities for overseas work.

## Qualifications

Although you don't need a degree, one in Computer Science or a related field would be beneficial. It's particularly helpful if you have experience of working with blockchain technology such as (e)UTXO, zero-knowledge proofs, or <<x>>. 

Skills

You will need to have:

* a feel for words and a good command of grammar and vocabulary
* the ability to express instructions clearly and briefly in simple language
* a concern for verbal consistency and an appreciation of tone and style
* good documentation skills and the ability to produce visually attractive instructions
* interpersonal and communication skills to effectively gather information
* an ability to grasp and structure large amounts of information and anticipate the reader's knowledge gaps
* an enquiring mind with attention to detail
* editorial judgement
* accuracy and a methodical approach to work
* the ability to work to tight schedules
* excellent planning and organisational skills
* analytical and questioning skills to get information from experts
* the ability to work successfully as part of a multidisciplinary team
* a good understanding of computers and other communication tools.

## Work experience

It's useful to have practical experience that relates to the job. This could be experience of writing guides or user manuals, either for companies as part of work experience or placements, or ones you've created for use in a portfolio. It could also include other writing assignments that show your ability to communicate with the reader.

Any experience that shows skills in related areas such as science and technology is also useful.
