After a very successful ErgoHack III, the jury has made their final decisions! There were so many amazing projects that participated in this last hackathon and as a result it was difficult to pick the top three prize winners. With that said, the jury was able to select three teams for the top prizes.

###  

For this hackathon, there were three main prizes as well as several special/participation awards: 10k SigUSD, 6K SigUSD and 2k SigUSD. The judges for the main prizes awarded points to each team out of a number from 1-10. The scores for each team were then tabulated to determine the winning teams. In addition to these main prizes, special prizes are being awarded from Dan Friedman (strategic advisor to Ergo Foundation), Joseph Armeanio (Business Manager, Ergo Foundation) and ErgoMixer developer, anon2020. 

## **ErgoHack III Winners**



Based on the tabulated scores we are pleased to announce the following winners:



### **1st Place - Stealth-Addresses Team 1** 

Stealth-addresses help to obfuscate receiving payments and are important for privacy-preserving commerce or private crowdfunding. This team's submission aligned perfectly with the theme of this recent ErgoHack III. They completed implementation of their project and this feature is now integrated within ErgoMixer.

### **2nd Place - SAFEW - Simple And Fast Ergo Wallet** 

SAFEW is a wallet that was developed during the hackathon and it is a much faster alternative to Yoroi. The team worked on Ledger integration and they made a great deal of progress, while providing good documentation. As part of their work, the team developed support for ErgoMixer and Ergo Pay implementation.

### **3rd Place - Nautilus**

Captain Nemo (from Nautilus) has quickly become an Ergo community celebrity! They have been incredibly active and seem to have worked tirelessly to design and create an Ergo web-extension wallet. Captain Nemo was a very busy participant in the ErgoHack chatrooms during the hackathon and was often assisting other wallets and dApp teams with their development and integration. The Nautilus wallet features full dApp connectivity and will also support integration with the Ledger hardware wallet.

This last ErgoHack had so much talent and it is clear the future of Ergo is looking very bright with each subsequent hackathon. These projects explored privacy and security and have added a great deal of functionality and infrastructure to the Ergo ecosystem and will continue to improve their projects long after this competition.
