## Step 1: Tools

[Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)  
Choose free community version, you will need to select desktop development with C++ package during install.

[CUDA toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads)    
Choose your system version, install with default options, it will update your graphics driver to a compatible version.

[Curl](https://curl.haxx.se/latest.cgi?curl=win64-nossl)   
Generic version without SSL, binary won`t work. Choose generic source, zip and click on show mirrors. Download and unpack.

[OpenSSL 1.0.2](https://slproweb.com/download/Win64OpenSSL-1_0_2s.exe)  
Download and install, select the OpenSSL binaries (/bin) directory during install.

[Autolykos GPU miner](https://github.com/ergoplatform/Autolykos-GPU-miner)  
Click on clone or download and download zip and unpack.

## Step 2: Building libcurl

Open the command line, go to ``c:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2017\Community\vc\Auxiliary\Build\`` and run this script: ``vcvarsall.bat x64``

Open the command line, go to unpacked Curl directory, then cd winbuild and run this command: ``nmake /f Makefile.vc mode=dll MACHINE=x64``

After a successful build, go to Curl directory, ``\curl\builds\libcurl-vc-x64-release-dll-ipv6-sspi-winssl\bin`` and copy ``libcurl.dll`` to ``\Autolykos\secp256k1`` directory. 

## Step 3: Building miner

Open the command line, go to ``c:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2017\Community\vc\Auxiliary\Build\`` and run this script: ``vcvars64.bat``

Open command line and go to unpacked Autolykos GPU miner directory, then cd ``secp256k1`` and edit ``winbuild.cmd`` file, change ``OPENSSL_DIR, LIBCURL_DIR`` to your OpenSSL and Curl main directories. You can change ``CUDA_COMPUTE_ARCH`` to GPU code architecture you want.

Run ``winbuild.cmd`` and build your miner. After succesful build you should discover miner.exe in the same directory.

## Step 4: Mining

Before you can mine, you have to [configure your node](https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo/wiki/Set-up-a-full-node), [wallet](https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2019_06_04_wallet-documentation/) and [miner](https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo/wiki/Mining)

After your node is synced, wallet is configured and unlocked, you have to create mining configuration file ``config.json`` with following structure: ``{ "seed" : "YourSeedString", "node" : "https://127.0.0.1:9052", "keepPrehash" : true }`` in the ``\Autolykos\secp256k1`` directory.

Open the command line and go to ``\Autolykos\secp256k1`` directory. Run ``miner.exe config.json``
