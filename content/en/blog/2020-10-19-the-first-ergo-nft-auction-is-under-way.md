*The first ever PoW-backed NFT was generated by Ergo developer anon_real, and is being sold to help fund creation of the new Ergo DEX.*

Ergo recently announced two major new developments: the [ability to create non-fungible tokens](https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020-09-25-nfts-on-ergo/), and the [Ergo Auction House, a Marketplace for NFTs](https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020-10-16-announcing-the-auction-house-nft-marketplace-on-ergo/).

**The very first Ergo NFT is [now for sale on Auction House](http://ergoauctions.org/#/auction/active).**

This is a unique, indivisible token mined by anon_real, one of Ergo’s anonymous devs. It is also the **first ever proof-of-work-backed token** on the platform. Moreover, it has the word ‘ergo’ hidden in its id:

24550c2dc71646fb369f1603f39f3e587c4c454e069036**6572676f**e985668c02

(The bolded characters, "6572676f", are the base16 encoding of "ergo".)

Anon_real is also developing Ergo’s DEX, and the ERG received from the same will be used to help fund that project. Between NFT auctions and the DEX, anon_real is contributing important infrastructure to Ergo’s DeFi ecosystem.

So, submit a bid, grab a piece of Ergo history, and help Ergo develop ground-breaking new DeFi technology!
