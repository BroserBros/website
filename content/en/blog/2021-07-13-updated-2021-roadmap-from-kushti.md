[Please see the full video for details on the ErgoVersary roadmap update](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCMpVRVrHqI&t=1s) 

#### Disclaimer:

*Ergo is community-driven with new members joining every day*

*Devs are not full-time, they come and go*

*Devs are anonymous*

# Ergo Development 21’ RoadMap

* Layers
* Ergo protocol research and development
* Reference Client Node
* Basic Infrastructure (libraries, explorer, wallets)
* Applications
* Social Impact (This will later be covered in a full video)

\*New partnerships are on the way

\*New Research is coming

\*Ergo is catching up with new trends.

## Main Directions

> "Hard-forks are painful." - Kushti

*Note:* Hard-forks are not expected in the future, the aim is to avoid hard-forks at all costs.

1. Networking Layer (efficiency)
2. Simplified contracts casting (next soft-fork) - ErgoTree Update
3. Ergo.Meta (Layer 2) - off-chain and side-chain solutions framework
4. ErgoTree - There will be only Velvet Soft Forks in the future

## Goals

* Ergo.Meta: Cookbook for off-chain and sidechain protocols on top of Ergo.
* High Throughput (rate of transaction processing)
* Improved Scalability (decreased latency)
* Improved Cross-Chain Operability
* Clean Wallet - Bootstrapping within minutes

## Ergo Infrastructure

### Wallets

**New Wallets Are Coming!**

1 - Cypro Wallet - Privacy-oriented mobile wallet with swaps.

2 - Ledger - Tesseract.one team continues to develop Ergo integration with Ledger and a demo will be released in the coming weeks. 

3 - ergowallet.io - desktop wallet with improved privacy - Community made wallet

4 - A new Android wallet is coming!

*\*Additional partnerships with other known wallets are currently in discussion.*

### Ergo Node - Reference Protocol Client

* [NIPoPoWs based boot-strapping](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/623.pdf) - Bootstrapping with UTXO based snapshots
* P2P Layers Improvement

Yoroi dApp Bridge has been [implemented](https://github.com/ergoplatform/eips/pull/23) and is under testing. We are expecting the first use will be on ErgoDEX.

### Libraries:

\- [Sigma-Rust](https://github.com/ergoplatform/sigma-rust) - good progress

\- [AppKit](https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo-appkit) - good progress

\- [JDE](https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo-jde) - recently released

## Ergo Applications

\- [ErgoDEX](https://ergodex.io/): Release is coming! Liquidity Mining will be available with SigUSD and ERG liquidity pools.

\- Gateways Under Testing: Multi-chain Ergo will be opened through [Gravity](https://gravity.tech/) integration. USDT, USDN, ETH, BTC and many more will be accessible on Ergo. Similarly, Ergo will be on BSC, Solana, Waves and many more blockchains.

\- ErgoFund - OnGoing : Foundation Fund implementation for future development resources.

\- ErgoTeam - OnGoing:  Community driven implementation of zero-knowledge spending vaults

\- LETS - Alternative Financial Systems: Implementation will start after ErgoFund.

## Tokenomics:

\-Tokenization of ErgoMixer - Contracts are done (other apps may follow -eg. ErgoAuctions)

\-Improved token sales via newer crowdfunding implementations.

\-More NFTs are being minted on Ergo Auctions.

\-Community will create and invent novel token schemes (ICO on Ergo). 

## Privacy

\-Apps on top of ErgoMixer (as API)

\-Stealth Pools & Mixing Pools

\-Private swaps with other schnorr + secp256k1 based currencies (like BTC)

\-Mixer Hops - Obfuscation Applications

## Hackathon Teams and Apps:

\-Ergo Raffle: Charity Lottery Implementation

\-SigmaStamp: Timestamping on Ergo

\-ErgoTeam: Zero-knowledge spending vaults

\-SmartPool: NIPoPoW based decentralized mining

\-ErgoIndex: Pegged token creation contract that will facilitate integration with traditional finance.

\-ErgoCharts: Charting application for Ergo ecosystem through oracle pools feed.

## Ergo Incubator and Community Funds

DarkFund0 - Still looking for applications

GoodWhale is looking for grants (it’s an anonymous investor, offering $20K in SigUSD)

More funds are coming!

Ergo Incubator - A project that will be funded by Ergo Foundation with weekly reports.
