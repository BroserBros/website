Announced today, the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority ([ACRA](https://www.acra.gov.sg/)) has approved Ergo Foundation Ltd as a corporate entity in Singapore. With this news, the Ergo Foundation establishes a clear pathway towards forming new official partnerships and listings on Tier 1 exchanges.



The Ergo Foundation has been working towards incorporation during this last year as a necessary step in legitimizing the ongoing work of the foundation and treasury. There are several official partnerships already in development and the establishment of the company creates a vehicle for the formalization of these collaborations. 



As an incorporated entity, Ergo Foundation Ltd can formally pursue the legal opinions necessary for Tier 1 exchange listings. Coupled with the recent engagement of Kairon Labs as a market maker for ERG, Ergo is positioning itself to be increasingly active in the cryptocurrency industry going forward.
