[The Ergo Auction House](https://ergoauctions.org/) is the open-source, decentralized NFT marketplace on the Ergo blockchain. Whether visual, audio or a custom token, users can list an NFT on Ergo Auctions or search for other NFTs to acquire. The first-ever NFT on Ergo was created almost [a year ago](https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020-10-19-the-first-ergo-nft-auction-is-under-way/), and Ergo Auction House has been welcoming many artists ever since then. 



We are proud to present the newly revamped Ergo Auction House v2 website with a renovated user interface and new smart contract upgrades.

After many long nights, anon_real has implemented the V2 contracts which allow for Artist Royalties, enabling artists to claim a percentage of every resale for their artwork. Users can now mint NFTs and start an auction all from within the same website. Artists will also be glad to hear that Luivatra has integrated a warning in case of a suspected counterfeit of NFTs before bidding. 



The Ergo NFT community is buzzing right now with new drops and new artists appearing every day (See [this previous article](https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2021-11-01-ergo-new-standard-for-nfts/) for more). Ergo NFTs are already easy and cost effective to mint, and the gasless approach of Ergo is built to sustain cheap fees in the future. A non-custodial wallet like Yoroi or Android wallet will be enough to get your hands on Ergo NFTs.
