*It’s been told that Bitcoin is used by criminals and terrorist organizations because it’s an anonymous peer-to-peer cash system. However, if you search for the on-chain data, you can actually see exactly which address is sending how much to another address at which time. That’s why it’s actually pseudo-anonymous, so parties involved can be tracked later on to see which other addresses they are interacting with. It’s impossible to link an address to a person however when that person uses an exchange to withdraw their funds to a bank account, it’s extremely easy to spot what kind of transactions that person made with which addresses.*



## User Security



So in hindsight, it’s better for individuals, because Bitcoin or public blockchains don’t give much of an open door for money laundering schemes. Malicious actors still need to use regulated corporations or some other schemes to launder money, after all, Bitcoin isn’t directly liquid and laundering money needs realization of assets to cold cash. What is on the blockchain doesn’t resemble anything in the off-chain world, it’s just numbers on blockchain going from point A to point B. When you consider that until 2009 there wasn’t Bitcoin and money laundering schemes were already happening, Bitcoin doesn’t offer extra properties for the malicious actors. Former CIA Acting Director Mitchell Morell revealed that [illicit financial activities on all cryptocurrencies between 2017-2020 take up to less than 1%](https://cryptoforinnovation.org/resources/Analysis_of_Bitcoin_in_Illicit_Finance.pdf). In the same report, he mentions that illicit activities with fiat money takes up to 2-4% of GDP.



Yet on the other side of the coin, pseudo-anonymity makes users vulnerable to malicious actors. A random spy actor can see your wallet and transactions and they can work towards an attack of any sort. It’s a genuine public key and you might don’t have any problem with sharing with others to receive funds but then it means that you are prone to being a target. When your wallet is linked with your ID, it means you are in the open zone that all kinds of interactions are traceable. You might also get caught up in interacting with another malicious address without you knowing it and it will leave big dirt on your own personal identity. Think about it like you are buying something from a street food shop and that street food shop is laundering money, when you take the change from your street food dealer that money will be always trackable in your wallet and you might be seen as a collaborator of a money-laundering scheme. 



That was just an example of how vulnerable you are as an individual when you’re using a public ledger blockchain. Normally, banks and governments keep the ledger private for you and themselves so when you(if you) trust your government you can feel safe that your information is private. However, the cypherpunk mentality calls for “*banking the unbanked without a bank*” thus you might also paraphrase it as “if you hold your keys, you can hold your coins”. That’s a payoff that you should choose: you can either trust your government and give your keys to them hoping that they will behave in a good manner to you, or you hold your own keys but then even though you are anonymous, all eyes can see your wallet without hassle.



## Money For The People



Call for action! As I said earlier, money laundering schemes were around before Bitcoin and even now they take up as much as 1% of total usage in crypto. When regulators are keeping a close eye on the public ledger, with the help of KYC exchanges, they can still know what you’re up to. In a way, you may think that’s okay because governments must prevent black money circulation to stop illegal activities. We think that’s okay too! However, up until now, they were closely following personal bank accounts and the only thing they prevented was individual users from freely using their funds. Big corporations can continue walking around legislation to evade taxes and bad actors use global money laundering schemes to continue using black money. What governments do is keeping a close eye on citizens by seeing them as potential money launderers. How does this sound?



Bitcoin FUD(Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) arguments made by regulators were mainly counting on the idea of Bitcoin as a private, anonymous, uncontrollable, and unstoppable money. We know that these cases aren’t true, we saw that cash was the primary money laundering tool and blockchain wallets are traceable. When you withdraw your money to your bank account, governments know what were you doing with your non-custodial wallet. The only case is then, you’re in control of your own funds, and you aren’t using “*legal*” fiat money controlled by central banks. That makes governments powerless on a global state because they can’t tell you what you should do with your funds or they can’t ban your bank account when they spot an unexpected activity. What remains is that they can question you about where did you get the money that you withdrew to your central bank account to pay your bills and make shopping etc. Also, they can’t ban your account, for example, when you didn’t pay your debts but let me ask again: Did these powers stop illicit financial activities, or prevent big players from taking delirious debts and going bankrupt? The answer is no, illicit financial activities continue happening elsewhere and institutions can rely on the “too big to fail” argument with the hope of bail-outs when they need them.

## Enhancing Privacy and Anonymity



For the protection of individuals, we have private chains or ‘[CoinJoin](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/coinjoin.asp)’ (coinmixer) apps that make users' wallets untraceable. Like I said this doesn’t mean that a user can launder money because every on-chain financial activity must end with an “integration” phase, which means withdrawing funds to the real, off-chain world. If you can prove that the custody of your funds wasn’t involved in any illicit financial activity, you shouldn’t be prevented from using privacy-enhancing tools to protect yourself in the on-chain world. You hold your keys, you hold your coins or in a reverse phrase- *not your keys, not your coins*. That also includes custodial exchange wallets because in centralized exchanges this is not any different from using a bank. You aren’t in crypto if you use only centralized exchanges, they can track you, prevent you or on the worst scale they can steal your coins(exit scams). 



That’s why decentralized finance protocols are entering their golden era now. You don’t have to give up the custody of your funds to use financial applications. Decentralized exchanges are becoming more efficient and cross-chain operations are becoming stronger by supporting all cryptosphere with a single non-custodial wallet. Coin mixing services don’t rely on custodial firms, they are working on zero-knowledge proofs. Decentralized applications are shining in a traditionally controlled government-backed finance world. A new history is upon us and we are just seeing the tip of the iceberg. Future is very exciting in this sense: Banking the bankless with decentralized applications, giving power to the people, draining seigniorage rights of governments and preventing bail-outs of “too-big-to-fail” institutions by infinite money printing -or how is it called in the fancy financial literature- by quantitative easing.



Ergo Blockchain provides a non-custodial coinjoin service, the [ErgoMixer](https://www.ergoforum.org/t/ergomixer-zerojoin-mixer-for-erg-and-tokens/318), as a dApp. It basically protects you from spy agents in the blockchain sphere. It is perfectly secure with its open-source code so that you know what you are interacting with. For more, Ergo Blockchain is a powerful network and it supports Layer 2 services on top of it so anyone can create private side-chains to use blockchain securely. We will provide more updates on the exact details of ErgoMixer later on and new developments on [Layer 2](https://www.ergoforum.org/t/stealth-address-contract/255) services and [privacy focused dApps](https://www.ergoforum.org/t/zero-knowledge-treasury-on-top-of-ergo/354) will soon flourish with new developers coming on board. 



*Ergo Blockchain isn’t built for governments or institutions, it's built for people by the people.*
