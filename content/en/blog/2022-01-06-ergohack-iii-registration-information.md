## Registering for ErgoHack III



ErgoScript knowledge is not a requirement to apply but the hackathon experience will be smoother and more efficient if you start learning that skill before the event in February. In order to apply for ErgoHack III, you need to propose a project or concept for developing privacy and security tools on Ergo.



When applying, you need a team of 2-5 people. Do not worry if you do not have a team, you can find teammates through i-need-a-team in the Ergo [Discord](https://discord.gg/EqZDrtzm) (under the “Development” category). If you have any other questions, you can also access sub-categories of discussions in Discord about developing on Ergo.



One of Ergo’s greatest strengths is the community. We have a vibrant and supportive developer community who can assist you as you explore ErgoScript and how to build on Ergo. 



When learning ErgoScript, we suggest you check the [Resources](https://ergohack.io/resources/) page and get familiar with coding smart contracts on the UTXO model. 



For two brief tutorials on ErgoScript and Appkit, you can also view the following videos:

Are you ready to build the next big project on Ergo? Prepare your proposal and be sure to submit your registration by January 31, 2022. Your proposal should include:



* A brief explanation of the skillsets of each team member and why they are important to the proposal.
* A brief explanation about the project and the solutions it will develop.
* A summary of any prep-work as well as any potential hurdles you foresee (if any)
* A brief explanation of the steps you envision being necessary to complete the project (can be listed as bullet points).
