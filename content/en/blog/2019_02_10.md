Data oracles are indispensable to blockchain infrastructure. In the first article in a series devoted to blockchain data oracles, we discuss how Waves’ protocol will help make an oracle accessible to the entire community.

A smart contract written on the blockchain is unable to access data outside its own network. This problem is resolved by using data oracles, which are basically agents that find real-world information and feed it to the blockchain for use by smart contracts and dApps.

Regardless of whether data is entered manually or automatically, the protocol includes fields for main values, which will help other community members to find the oracle and learn what type of data it feeds to the blockchain, what the third-party source is and how frequently the data is updated.

A developer can use an existing protocol, which is available on Waves’ GitBook, or expand it, if necessary.

The process is simple. To make things easier for developers, Waves offers a data oracle developing tool, which will be integrated in a single interface with a public directory of data oracles, broken down by category.

If a developer wants their oracle to be accessible to other members of the Waves community, helping the entire ecosystem and also generating revenues, they can fill in various DataTransaction fields, describing the oracle.
