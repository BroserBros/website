**Ergo, a community-centered proof-of-work protocol is launching its first-ever hackathon next week, ERGOHACK.** 

It is our goal at Ergo to create a network for the people, censorship-resistant, resilient, open and free. It is our goal to build a system that creates smart contracts for the people, to put tooling in the hands of those that need it the most.  

The hackathon will run June 11-13th with crypto prizes for the top three slots and all presenters. 

Submissions must be filed by June 8th with the deadline for submitting solutions set for June 14th. 

Ergo is looking for solutions from teams that want to “hack for change” surrounding topics like tokenization schemes, visual tools for constructing multi-signatures, stealth address pool implementations, tools for NFTs and many more.  The winning teams will be announced on June 21st, with the following prizes up for grabs:

**1st Place**: 5,000 SigmaUSD\
**2nd Place**: 2,500 SigmaUSD\
**3rd Place**: 1,000 SigmaUSD\
*All presenters will receive 100 SigmaUSD.*
