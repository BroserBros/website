As our first hackathon grows ever closer, Ergonauts and the Ergo community are excited to present our judges for ERGOHACK.\
\
From June 11th-13th, these judges will evaluate proposals on topics like tokenization schemes, visual tools for constructing multi-signatures, stealth address pool implementations, tools for NFTs and many more.\
\
So without further ado, allow us to introduce…\
\
\
**Alexander Slesarenko**



Slesarenko is an ERGO Foundation Board Member and graduate of Applied Mathematics from Udmurt State University. He has extensive experience in software development as a team leader, architect and researcher. He worked as Team Leader at Huawei Research Lab focusing on developing languages and compilers for high-performance big data processing. Alexander is a Blockchain Core Developer and Lead Developer of ErgoScript at ERGO.



**Aleksei Pupyshev**



Aleksei initially became involved in the crypto space in 2014, when he led a team at an algorithmic HFT hedge fund focusing on mining pool analytics and developing liquidity models for one of the first crypto exchanges. 



In 2015, when Ethereum became popular, Aleksei hired an R&D team to prototype a smart contract crypto loan service. Two years later, realizing the full power of smart contacts and decentralization, Aleksei started working on crypto projects more actively by founding Venlab.

In 2019, the Venlab team entered a partnership with the Waves ecosystem to develop the Neutrino stablecoin and Gravity inter-chain protocol. After successfully launched, both of the projects were fully transferred to Waves in 2020 and 2021 correspondingly. Aleksei is currently also the Founder of Graviton, and a Co-Founder of Neutrino protocol and Gravity protocol.

In 2019, he became a dLab/EMURGO Fellow, following that up in 2020 as EMURGO’s Head of R&D and board member of the ERGO Foundation. In 2021 he co-founded a new crypto development company, dcSpark.\
\
Robert has worked on numerous projects within the Ergo ecosystem including oracle pools, the headless dApp framework, and ErgoScript by example, ageUSD and more. He has also conducted extensive research on what is possible in the EUTXO model.
