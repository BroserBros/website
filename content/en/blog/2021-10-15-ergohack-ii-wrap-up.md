After weeks of preparation and an intense weekend, we have completed ERGOHACK II! Thank you to all participants and spectators who participated - it was an exciting event to host and we loved seeing all the collaboration!



As you may know, hackathons gather coders to work on projects about specific topics. ERGOHACK II: Social Transformation aimed to produce early prototypes for the Ergo Platform. It promoted the use of ErgoScript as a programming tool while building up solid foundations for the community. In the final phase of ERGOHACK II, we witnessed the birth of nine new projects come, each of them with a different goal.



ErgoHack was held on Ergo Platform's Discord, where mentors and participants could communicate in public channels and welcomed the incoming community. During the event, non-tech participants were able to gain insights through released interviews with [Kushti](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7C3lyyhSP0), [Armeanio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqun_AQvCw4), as well as a few guest interviews from the Cardano ecosystem: [Long Nguyen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tA7ZSRCodE) and [Patrick Tobler](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQGSzJHZJNE&t=347s). 



ERGOHACK II was a quest for exploration on UTXO based smart contracts and the products we see today are essential for the Ergo Platform's ecosystem. Ergo is an open-source blockchain project that grows with collaboration and each discovery is a stepping stone for what is to come after.



Let's take a look at some of the projects from ERGOHACK II:



## Ergo-Lend



Ergo-Lend is a peer-to-peer lending platform. It aims to create an on-chain platform for people to lend/borrow money. You can find the teams work [here](https://github.com/Ergo-Lend/ergo-lend-documentation) and their front-end draft [here](https://www.ergolend.org/#).



## Ergo-Audio



The Ergo-Audio team is the same team that proposed SmartPools in the first ErgoHack. Inspired by “FunkWhale,”, they aim to build a streaming service on the blockchain that can operate with a Creative Commons licence. Their proposition also includes NIPoPoWs for light clients and oracle pools for data verification. You can find their last proposal in [the Ergo-Audio](https://discord.gg/k3MHPXKg) channel.



## HYPO10USE (Quid Games)



HYPO10USE (Quid Games) was a group of developers coming from EVM/BSC. They aimed to create a decentralized betting game for people to play. Their design incorporated ergo-raffle design inspired by the popular Netflix series Squid Game. You can find their work on [GitHub](https://github.com/hypo10use/quid-games) and check out a demo of the site here. 



## Minotaur



The Minotaur team aims to build a functional Ergo wallet for both Android, iOS, Windows and Linux. They aim to develop a multiplatform wallet that will support dApps with cold & hot wallet functions. You can find their release [here](https://github.com/minotaur-ergo/minotaur-wallet).



## Ergo-Subpools



Subpools is a solo project which is a development on SmartPools from the first ERGOHACK. It aims to build a smart-contract-based mining pool. It is incredibly important to create a decentralized & trustless blockchain by eliminating the need for a mining-pool operator. You can find the code [here](https://github.com/K-Singh/ergo-subpooling).



## Graviton



The Graviton team (from the Graviton One project) is building bridges among blockchain ecosystems. Apart from deploying GTON/SigUSD and GTON/USDT pair, their work during ERGOHACK helped lay the foundations towards integrating the Wormhole bridge between Ergo and Solana ecosystems. They will release their code soon.



## Ergo-Pad



The ErgoPad team aim to consolidate all of the  holdings for Ergonauts (including NFTs and native tokens) in a visually clean dashboard.



The builder of ergonfts.org and ergotutorials.com, LadoPixel, also surprised us with a tool to view and store multiple wallets simultaneously! You can test the project [here](https://ergowallets.org/).



## Oracle-Pools



While not a formal submission, community member Luivatra created an ETH-connector and has booted up an [ETH/USD oracle](https://i.imgur.com/0nueBER.png)! You can find the code for the ETH-connector [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ergonauts/comments/q6jn65/ergohack_ii_update/).



We are delighted with the results so far! Ergo Platform's repository is growing, with several more ErgoScript-By-Examples available, thanks to many newcomers! Do not worry if you missed it, all the resources are available [here](https://ergohack.io/resources/) to onboard you in the Ergo ecosystem. For any other questions, you can communicate directly with the team on Telegram & Discord.



Thank you for participating and we look forward to the next ERGOHACK!
