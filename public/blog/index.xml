      <description>Overview Ergo’s native token is called Erg and its emission schedule may be of keen interest to users and miners of the platform. Ergs also have some unique characteristics which are highlighted in this post. Most basically and leaving out technical details, Ergo has a strictly limited supply, an 8‐year emission schedule and a declining rate of emission over these 8 years. All tokens are mined through an original Asic and Pool‐resistant Proof‐of‐Work (“PoW”) algorithm called Autolykos.</description>

      <description>Step 1: Tools Visual Studio https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/
Choose free community version, you will need to select desktop development with C++ package during install.
CUDA toolkit https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads
Choose your system version, install with default options, it will update your graphics driver to a compatible version.
Curl https://curl.haxx.se/latest.cgi?curl=win64-nossl
Generic version without SSL, binary won`t work. Choose generic source, zip and click on show mirrors. Download and unpack.
OpenSSL 1.0.2 https://slproweb.com/download/Win64OpenSSL-1_0_2r.exe

      <title>A Local Exchange Trading System On Top Of Ergo</title>
      <link>https://ergoplatform.org/blog/2019_04_22-lets/</link>

      <description>A local exchange trading system (LETS) is a local mutual credit association which members are allowed to create common credit money individually, with all the deals in the system written into a common ledger. As an example, assume that Alice with zero balance is willing to buy a liter of raw milk from Bob. First, they agree on a price, for example, assume that the price is about 2 Euro (as Alice and Bob are living in Ireland).</description>

      <title>An ICO Example On Top Of Ergo</title>
      <link>https://ergoplatform.org/blog/2019_04_10-ico-example/</link>

      <description>This article describes a full featured ICO (Initial Coin Offering) implemented in ErgoScript. The example covers several important and novel features of the Ergo Platform and shows how it can support complex contracts with tiny amount of code.
Part 1. Preliminaries An important design decision in a cryptocurrency protocol is specifying what a spending transaction actually spends. There are two possibilities here. The first a UTXO-based model, as in Bitcoin, where a transaction spends one-time asset containers (called as &amp;lsquo;coins&amp;rsquo; or UTXOs in Bitcoin) and creates new ones.</description>

      <title>Q&amp;A with Alex Chepurnoy and Dmitry Meshkov</title>

      <description>First, we have a major announcement - Ergo mainnet launch is planned for May 26 if no security vulnerabilities will be found during audit process!
What are the vision about scaling and adoption?
About scaling, the main approach is to avoid bloat without compromising functionality. E.g. persistent updateable storage is possible, with updates to be checked by a blockchain contract, but only digest of authenticated data structure (and some additional bytes, less than 40 bytes anyway) are stored in the UTXO set dependless on data set size.</description>

      <title>Smart Contracts for the People</title>
      <link>https://ergoplatform.org/blog/2018_10_19-smart-contracts/</link>

      <description>A lot of blockchain-related news these days are saying us that a bank X or a corporation Y is going to use a &amp;ldquo;blockchain&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;reduce costs&amp;rdquo;. Basically it means that just another buzzword is considered by big banksters as just another tool to extract value from everywhere in a more efficient way, and also to save on cutting job positions.
While I am avoiding to say anything about &amp;ldquo;Satoshi&amp;rsquo;s vision&amp;rdquo; (nothing but speculations could be dug there after his exodus), a broad view I witnessed in the early years around online forums users is that a cryptocurrency should provide tools to enrich the ordinary people behind their small businesses providing no much above making ends meet, not depersonalized big financial capital.</description>
