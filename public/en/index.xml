      <description>In today&amp;rsquo;s article, we will have a closer look into the Ergo address formatting. In addition to that we are going to explain how they work specifically as well as what makes them preferable to other types of blockchain addresses.
Let&amp;rsquo;s start at the very beginning.
The moment you install any cryptocurrency wallet you automatically create an address with it. Very loosely speaking you can compare a wallet to a traditional bank account and an address to the matching account number.</description>

      <description>Firstly, we would like to thank many enthusiasts, developers, miners, other folks, and our families for measureless help with Ergo development and launching. The launch finishes a few years period of initial research and development by the Team, and also starts a new epoch, where the core technology is mostly set in stone and gradual improvements in protocol implementations and infrastructure projects become the main focus.
The current core Ergo Core Team remains fully committed to the project (at least, while the Foundation Treasury enables that).</description>

      <description>An Ergo node provides a built-in wallet for storing private keys and signing transactions. The following describes how to set up and protect your Ergo wallet.
The wallet uses the BIP39 standard to generate a seed from a mnemonic sentence, which is then used to generate the private keys according to the BIP32 standard  (Hierarchical Deterministic Wallets). You can use your own mnemonic sentence composed of the words from one of these wordists if you want to.</description>

      <description>A Local Exchange Trading System (LETS) is aimed at developing local economy and is usually used by people of a locality in the vicinity of each other. For a brief overview of LETS see this link, which also describes an ErgoScript implementation of a committee managed LETS. We call such a system a managed or permissioned, since it depends on a committee of trusted members to enroll new members into the LETS.</description>

      <description>Overview Ergo’s native token is called Erg and its emission schedule may be of keen interest to users and miners of the platform. Ergs also have some unique characteristics which are highlighted in this post. Most basically and leaving out technical details, Ergo has a strictly limited supply, an 8‐year emission schedule and a declining rate of emission over these 8 years. All tokens are mined through an original Asic and Pool‐resistant Proof‐of‐Work (“PoW”) algorithm called Autolykos.</description>

      <description>A local exchange trading system (LETS) is a local mutual credit association which members are allowed to create common credit money individually, with all the deals in the system written into a common ledger. As an example, assume that Alice with zero balance is willing to buy a liter of raw milk from Bob. First, they agree on a price, for example, assume that the price is about 2 Euro (as Alice and Bob are living in Ireland).</description>

      <description>This article describes a full featured ICO (Initial Coin Offering) implemented in ErgoScript. The example covers several important and novel features of the Ergo Platform and shows how it can support complex contracts with tiny amount of code.
Part 1. Preliminaries An important design decision in a cryptocurrency protocol is specifying what a spending transaction actually spends. There are two possibilities here. The first a UTXO-based model, as in Bitcoin, where a transaction spends one-time asset containers (called as &amp;lsquo;coins&amp;rsquo; or UTXOs in Bitcoin) and creates new ones.</description>

      <description>First, we have a major announcement - Ergo mainnet launch is planned for May 26 if no security vulnerabilities will be found during audit process!
What are the vision about scaling and adoption? About scaling, the main approach is to avoid bloat without compromising functionality. E.g. persistent updateable storage is possible, with updates to be checked by a blockchain contract, but only digest of authenticated data structure (and some additional bytes, less than 40 bytes anyway) are stored in the UTXO set dependless on data set size.</description>

      <title>Smart Contracts for the People</title>

      <description>A lot of blockchain-related news these days are saying us that a bank X or a corporation Y is going to use a &amp;ldquo;blockchain&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;reduce costs&amp;rdquo;. Basically it means that just another buzzword is considered by big banksters as just another tool to extract value from everywhere in a more efficient way, and also to save on cutting job positions.
While I am avoiding to say anything about &amp;ldquo;Satoshi&amp;rsquo;s vision&amp;rdquo; (nothing but speculations could be dug there after his exodus), a broad view I witnessed in the early years around online forums users is that a cryptocurrency should provide tools to enrich the ordinary people behind their small businesses providing no much above making ends meet, not depersonalized big financial capital.</description>
