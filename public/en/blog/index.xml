      <description>Spending mining reward This text is to help miners to withdraw funds mined.
A lot of folks launched a node and also a miner, with &amp;ldquo;pubkeyHex&amp;rdquo; from the miner embedded in the node config. Now information on how to recognize the coins mined and withdraw them to another address.
On keys. A miner can see a lot of keys in different formats.
First, mining software and also mining support in the node (namely, ergo.</description>

      <description>Joining the Ergo main network at the very beginning In order to join the network at its very beginning and compete to mine the genesis block, you need to follow the steps described below. If you&amp;rsquo;re not going to participate in Ergo mining and just want to set up a full node, you need to follow steps 3 and 5.
Preparations 1. Build mining software Check the guide first.</description>

      <description>An Ergo node provides a built-in wallet for storing private keys and signing transactions. The following describes how to set up and protect your Ergo wallet.
The wallet uses the BIP39 standard to generate a seed from a mnemonic sentence, which is then used to generate the private keys according to the BIP32 standard  (Hierarchical Deterministic Wallets). You can use your own mnemonic sentence composed of the words from one of these wordists if you want to.</description>

      <title>A Trustless Local Exchange Trading System</title>

      <description>A Local Exchange Trading System (LETS) is aimed at developing local economy and is usually used by people of a locality in the vicinity of each other. For a brief overview of LETS see this link, which also describes an ErgoScript implementation of a committee managed LETS. We call such a system a managed or permissioned, since it depends on a committee of trusted members to enroll new members into the LETS.</description>

      <title>The Ergo Emission Schedule</title>
      <link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2019_05_20-curve/</link>

      <description>Overview Ergo’s native token is called Erg and its emission schedule may be of keen interest to users and miners of the platform. Ergs also have some unique characteristics which are highlighted in this post. Most basically and leaving out technical details, Ergo has a strictly limited supply, an 8‐year emission schedule and a declining rate of emission over these 8 years. All tokens are mined through an original Asic and Pool‐resistant Proof‐of‐Work (“PoW”) algorithm called Autolykos.</description>

      <description>Step 1: Tools Visual Studio
Choose free community version, you will need to select desktop development with C++ package during install.
CUDA toolkit
Choose your system version, install with default options, it will update your graphics driver to a compatible version.
Curl
Generic version without SSL, binary won`t work. Choose generic source, zip and click on show mirrors. Download and unpack.
OpenSSL 1.0.2
Download and install, select the OpenSSL binaries (/bin) directory during install.</description>

      <title>A Local Exchange Trading System On Top Of Ergo</title>
      <link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2019_04_22-lets/</link>

      <description>A local exchange trading system (LETS) is a local mutual credit association which members are allowed to create common credit money individually, with all the deals in the system written into a common ledger. As an example, assume that Alice with zero balance is willing to buy a liter of raw milk from Bob. First, they agree on a price, for example, assume that the price is about 2 Euro (as Alice and Bob are living in Ireland).</description>

      <title>An ICO Example On Top Of Ergo</title>
      <link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2019_04_10-ico-example/</link>

      <description>This article describes a full featured ICO (Initial Coin Offering) implemented in ErgoScript. The example covers several important and novel features of the Ergo Platform and shows how it can support complex contracts with tiny amount of code.
Part 1. Preliminaries An important design decision in a cryptocurrency protocol is specifying what a spending transaction actually spends. There are two possibilities here. The first a UTXO-based model, as in Bitcoin, where a transaction spends one-time asset containers (called as &amp;lsquo;coins&amp;rsquo; or UTXOs in Bitcoin) and creates new ones.</description>

      <title>Q&amp;A with Alex Chepurnoy and Dmitry Meshkov</title>
      <link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2019_03_19-qa/</link>

      <description>First, we have a major announcement - Ergo mainnet launch is planned for May 26 if no security vulnerabilities will be found during audit process!
What are the vision about scaling and adoption? About scaling, the main approach is to avoid bloat without compromising functionality. E.g. persistent updateable storage is possible, with updates to be checked by a blockchain contract, but only digest of authenticated data structure (and some additional bytes, less than 40 bytes anyway) are stored in the UTXO set dependless on data set size.</description>

      <title>Smart Contracts for the People</title>
      <link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2018_10_19-smart-contracts/</link>

      <description>A lot of blockchain-related news these days are saying us that a bank X or a corporation Y is going to use a &amp;ldquo;blockchain&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;reduce costs&amp;rdquo;. Basically it means that just another buzzword is considered by big banksters as just another tool to extract value from everywhere in a more efficient way, and also to save on cutting job positions.
While I am avoiding to say anything about &amp;ldquo;Satoshi&amp;rsquo;s vision&amp;rdquo; (nothing but speculations could be dug there after his exodus), a broad view I witnessed in the early years around online forums users is that a cryptocurrency should provide tools to enrich the ordinary people behind their small businesses providing no much above making ends meet, not depersonalized big financial capital.</description>
